Library: Provides access to groups of .package files based on the same mechanics that the games uses, i.e. resource.cfg
Package: Provides access to DBPF files
ResourceCFG: Provides resource.cfg file parsing support
Resources: Provides access to the individual "files" stored inside a DBPF file.
TS3Pack: Implements reading of .sims3pack files.  Uses substream to allow a package to be read directly from the sims3pack file.
